i wield unfathomable power over your headset,

### What is this
This is a simulation of headsets, built from scratch with pincushion distortion correction, a (somewhat) working physics engine (it doesnt collide), and with all the basic transforms for a 3d model.<br>
This was used to test IMU data to provide insights about how the said headset corrects tilt errors, and orientation, moreover account for lens distortion.
